## Overview

JobTrack is the perfect app for keeping track of your job applications. With JobTrack, you can easily add and organize all the jobs you've applied and assign your application status to them (applied, on site, offer, etc). On top of that, you can view your stats in chart form or even export all your data to CSV to take a closer look at it. The UI is intuitive and clean and doesn't require you to make an account. JobTrack is available on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS (coming soon), and with iCloud, all your data will sync between your devices.
